# ML-Assisted Melanoma Diagnosis System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of an Machine Learning (ML) system designed to assist in the diagnosis of melanoma. Utilizing the comprehensive ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) database, the system aims to analyze dermatoscopic images and provide supportive diagnostic information.

## Objective

The primary goal is to leverage modern machine learning techniques to build a robust model capable of differentiating between benign and malignant skin lesions, thereby aiding clinicians and potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

## Context

This initiative serves as a platform to address real-world challenges in medical imaging. It is designed to apply and evaluate contemporary machine learning methodologies in the critical domain of dermatological cancer detection. The project emphasizes practical problem-solving and the application of state-of-the-art AI approaches to medical data.

## Scope (Initial Focus)

The current phase typically involves:

* **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Sourcing and preparing images and metadata from the ISIC database.
* **Model Development:** Designing, training, and validating deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs) for image classification.
* **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics and validation strategies.
